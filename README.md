## Getting Started
This is just the start of a basic RMA Helpdesk solution. Using mongodb as a backend and next js for front and back. 
Next js is in development mode and mongo db has no authentication so don't use this in production but it should be easy to fork are reconfigure

```bash
podman compose up -d
```

Mogodb needs a database named rmadb

.env contains database endpoint 

mogo express is at 
http://localhost:8081/

next js is at 
http://localhost:3000/
